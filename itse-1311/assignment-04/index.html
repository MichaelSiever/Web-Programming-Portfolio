				<h2>Does the prospect of Mayor David S. Pumpkins getting re-elected <em>scare</em> you?</h2>
			
				<p>Well, they should, because his failures have been nothing short of 
				<em>frightening!</em> During his <em>ghastly</em> first term in office, David has:
			
				<ul>
					<li>Failed to pay his <em>pumpkin taxes</em> in 4 years, despite having
					campaigned on everybody in Pumpkinville paying their fair share</li>
					<li>Allowed the criminals that he promised to <em>scare</em> out of town
					to run even more rampantly than before he took office</li>
					<li>Allowed professional developers to ruin the asthetic of our
					town by drastically reducing the size of our tombs in favor
					of building more <em>Big-Boo</em> retail stores that we already have 
					a surplus of</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h2>In short, David S. Pumpkins getting re-elected as Mayor of Pumpkinville would
				be an absolute <em>nightmare!</em> Any questions?!</h2>

				<h2>Meet Hal O'Ween, a <em>spooktacular</em> choice for Pumpkinville Mayor!</h2>
				
				<p>As your next Mayor, Hal O'Ween will:
				
				<ul>
					<li><em>Slash</em> pumpkin taxes for all Pumpkinville residents, regardless of their income class</li>
					<li><em>Bury</em> crime <em>six-feet under</em> in the Pumpkinville Town cemetary</li>
					<li><em>Scare</em> those out-of-town developers out of here, so we can go back
					to making Pumpkinville the <em>spookiest haunt</em> on this side of <em>Death Canyon</em></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>So, don't <em>dread</em> the <em>woeful</em> activities of our <em>horrendous</em> Mayor, 
				and make your plan to vote for Hal O'Ween this election cycle!</h2>
